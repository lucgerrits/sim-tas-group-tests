# Manual Demos

Milestone 1 deliverables are marked by tag [milestone1](https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_cpp/tree/milestone1)

## Deliverable 1

### The project can be built with provided instructions on bare installation of Ubuntu Linux 16.04.

For convenience the Dockerfile is provided that installs all dependencies as needed, checks out the code for the API and builds it. In order to execute single API tests manually, please have docker CE installed, then clone this repository and run following commands (first one takes ~20 minutes to run for the first time):
```
$ docker build -t cppapi .
$ docker run -it --rm cppapi /bin/sh
# cd polkadot_api_cpp
```

Now you are connected to a running docker container with API built, tested, and ready. You can execute following commands to examine deliverables.

### Connection:
- Connection to a public Substrate node (at URL wss://poc3-rpc.polkadot.io:443/) can be established through WebSocket with API connect command.
- Connection to a public node can be closed with API disconnect command.

```
bin/connect
```

#### Nodeâ€™s TLS certificate is verified during connection process

This unit test hides file 'ca-chain.cert.pem' that contains trusted root CA certificate making it impossible to verify node's TLS certificate:
```
bin/connect_failed_tls
```

### Basic data can be read from the node, deserialized to appropriate C++ struct and returned from API, which includes following Test-RPC commands:

#### chain_getBlockHash
```
bin/connectApp
```

#### chain_getRuntimeVersion (and alias state_getRuntimeVersion)
```
bin/connectApp
```

#### state_getMetadata
```
bin/get_metadata
```

#### system_properties, system_chain, system_name, system_version
```
bin/connectApp
```

### Command line tool is provided to execute all milestone deliverables

Currently unit tests, see above

### Building instructions, initialization, and library usage documented

- Building: See [root level README.md](https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_cpp/blob/master/README.md)
- Lib usage: See doc/html folder


## Deliverable 2 - WebSocket Subscriptions

### API can be subscribed and unsibscribed. Current block subscription, which is provided by chain_subscribeNewHead subscription.
```
bin/wssubscribeApp
```

### Balance subscription, which is provided by state_subscribeStorage subscription
```
bin/wssubscribeBalance
```

Expect output such as:
```
...
2019-07-12 15:09:27,114 INFO [default] Subscribed with subscription ID: 2760311

  Balance: 201020000000000

2019-07-12 15:09:27,506 INFO [default] runWsMessages Thread exited
success
```

### Current era and session subscription
```
bin/wssubscribeAppEraNSession
```

## Deliverable 3 - Signing and Sending Transactions

- One transaction type is supported - sending DOTs to another address
- Transaction is serialized and prepared (formatted) appropriately for signing
- Transaction can be signed with provided private key
- Cryptogram can be sent to the substrate node to be processed and included in the blockchain
- Command line tool is provided to execute all milestone deliverables
```
bin/transfer <sender address> <recipient address> <amount in fDOTs> <sender private key (hex)>

for example:

bin/transfer 5ECcjykmdAQK71qHBCkEWpWkoMJY6NXvpdKy8UeMx16q5gFr 5FpxCaAovn3t2sTsbBeT5pWTj2rg392E8QoduwAyENcPrKht 1000000000000000000 0xABCDEF123.....123
(private key was corrupted on purpose, both hex formats with or without leading 0x are supported)
```

Expect output such as:
```
2019-07-12 15:04:24,865 INFO [default] Message received: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"author_extrinsicUpdate","params":{"result":{"finalized":"0x37361e7f88a9105b103b32458e2748ec4758ec8dca733da61c1403d9bda70d42"},"subscription":2758756}}
